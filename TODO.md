# TODO
 - [x] import the projects
 - [x] add a way to update the projects (maybe consider to find and make the projects list each time the code is executed)
 - [x] remove the project_category attribute because it does nothing
 - [x] get the main projects directory(s) from the user. in my case is /home/diverso/p
 - [x] add --include-dir
 - [ ] add --add-path
